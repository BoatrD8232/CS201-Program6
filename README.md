There are two mediaList files and two mediaCommand files. The files that end in 2 are the files that were linked in the program instructions. These will output the same report files as those linked in the program instructions.
The files that do not end in 2 are the ones included in the started code from the github link.
To swap between the files, simply add a 2 or remove the 2 before .txt on line 16 and line 18 in CS201R-PGM6.cpp
